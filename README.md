# JOINS-PRACTICE

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTION

*NAME*: DEVISRI.S

*INTERN ID*: CT04DF1284

*DOMAIN*: SQL

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: 📝 Task Description:
In this task, I practiced and executed different types of SQL join operations using online compilers such as OneCompiler and other SQL execution tools. The aim was to develop a clear understanding of how different types of joins work and how they are used to merge and retrieve data from two or more related tables in a relational database.

The following types of joins were implemented:

🔹 INNER JOIN – To retrieve only the matching records from both tables.

🔹 LEFT JOIN – To fetch all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.

🔹 RIGHT JOIN – To fetch all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.

🔹 FULL JOIN – To retrieve all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

💻 Tools Used:
OneCompiler.com (SQL) – An online compiler to write and execute SQL queries efficiently without local setup.

Online SQL Playground tools – For simulating database environments and viewing outputs quickly.

📊 Deliverables:
SQL scripts containing INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOIN queries.

Screenshot outputs of the result tables for each join type.

Sample tables with inserted data for demonstration purposes.
